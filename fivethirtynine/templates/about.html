       <p>2018 was an exhausting year in America.  The two major political parties clashed over issues large and small, including climate change, tax policy, President Trump’s conduct, a heated midterm election, and the Supreme Court. With so many important news events and political developments occurring at warp-speed throughout the year, it was difficult to parse through what truly mattered - and why.  By studying larger trends in politics, the economy, and the media, one can gain a greater understanding for the the complicated interplay between these facets of American society.  Looking back through the year that was, we can gain a greater understanding for where we’ve been, and perhaps more importantly, where we’re going.

      Our project, FiveThirtyNine, aimed to organize economic data,  national political indicators (including President Trump’s approval rating and generic ballot party preferences), and top news headlines all in one easy-to-use to use platform.  Meant for political junkies and casual observers alike, FiveThirtyNine has a variety of features that allow the user to study the national trends that defined 2018.  The calendar feature provides data on stock indices, top news headlines, twitter trends, and political measurements for each day in 2018, allowing the user to explore at their own pace.  We also wanted users to be able to dive into the data more deeply, so we created a functionality that allows users to search keywords such as “Hurricane” or “Saudi Arabia” to see how President Trump’s approval rating changed the last time these topics were in the national discussion.  Users can also pick a range of dates for which they can see the dataset of their choice visualized graphically, or see a wordcloud composed of the news headlines and Twitter trends in that timeframe.  Finally, users can explore what occurred during the most volatile days of Donald Trump’s presidency, and directly see how national news events impact the political players in our democratic system.

  			We used Flask and python for the back-end, hosted our databases on Amazon Web Services, and use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap<br>
  		and JavaScript for the front-end. For the graphing and interactive calendar features, we have used Bokeh.</p></div>
